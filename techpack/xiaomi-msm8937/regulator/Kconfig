	  This driver supports TPS65132 voltage regulator chips. The chip has
          a synchronous boost converter that generates a positive voltage which
	  is regulated down by an integrated LDO, providing a positive supply
          rail. It also has a negative supply rail which is generated by an
          integrated negative charge pump driven from the boost converter
          output. Both output regulators support 4V~6V voltage range and
	  can be configured separately. Each regulator can be enabled and
          disabled independently through an external pin.
